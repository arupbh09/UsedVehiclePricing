# Title: Predictive model to determine the price of used cars

## Description
### In this project, we used data collected from Kaggle containing 426K records of used car sales, with pricing.
### For this project, we explored the dataset using visualization, and then prepared the data for modeling, tried and evaluated different Regression Models
### We selected the best performing Lasso Regression model, used the coefficients to draw out insights regarding what drives price of a used car; what do consumers prefer

## Installation

### The project in the repository will include the following files
#### Readme file: Readme.md
#### Jupyter Notebook: UsedCarPriceModel_V2.ipynb
#### Data file: vehicles.csv

### Create a project directory and loading the Jupyter notebook
#### Download CouponSelectionModel.ipynb file ont to the project directory
#### Upload file onto the Jupyter Notebook and open it

### Data set up: 
#### Create the directory data/ under the root directory of Jupypter Notebook
#### Save the vehicles.csv file under this directory


## Usage
#### After setting up the data, you can run the Python code in the Jupyter notebook 
#### The code has markdown sections that outline the approach of the analysis and can help you understand the logic
#### Upon running the code, you will generate string outputs, plotly and seaborn plots

## Data
### This data comes to us from Kaggle with about 426K sales record of used cars
### The data contains the price of the used car and key details of make, model, year
### The data also contains key characteristics of the used car - size, type, drive type, transmission, condition, title_status
### Finally the data contains the state and region where the vehicle was sold

## Contribution
### You can extend and refine the model by exploring the following
#### Analyze the data for less expensive cars and develop customized data cleaning processes
#### Analyze the data for more expensive cars and develop customized data cleaning processes
#### You can conduct additional feature engineering - for example combining make and model of the car
#### You can explore linear regression with sequential feature selection
### You can save the visualization plots as png files
